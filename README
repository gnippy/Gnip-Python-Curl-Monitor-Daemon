Curl Process Watcher

Starts a daemon to watch a persistent (streaming http) curl process.

USAGE: procWatch.py start|stop|restart|test

Starts, Stops and restarts both curl process and the watcher daemon.

Parameters are in local configuration file named "watcher.cfg"
This configuration file is typically placed in your working directory. For 
more information on path and precedence, see Python documentation for ini
files.

The working directory will contain any http cache entries. There may be none, 
but process will fail if this directory is not writable.  The working directory
path string is also used to identify the watched process, so use a different 
working directory for each process you want to watch.

Data files will be named "output_file_base_name_YYYYmmdd_HHMM.xml"

Data files get new name when (1) curl process dies and is automatically 
restarted by the watcher or (2) new-file-interval seconds have elapsed since
start, restart or last new file start.
